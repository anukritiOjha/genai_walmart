Gen AI with Element 
Course Description: 
This 4-day course equips participants to design and deploy enterprise-ready GenAI applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Participants will work hands-on with tools such as LangChain, OpenAI, and Milvus to develop scalable GenAI prototypes.
Course Learning Objectives: 
‚Ä¢	Understand the GenAI landscape and LLM architecture
‚Ä¢	Design and evaluate prompt engineering strategies
‚Ä¢	Develop applications using LangChain and RAG patterns
‚Ä¢	Build and deploy agent-based GenAI assistants
‚Ä¢	Execute a hands-on hackathon using enterprise use cases
